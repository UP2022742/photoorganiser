# Photo Organiser
Organises photos into folders based on their date of creation. The script will also check the validity of the photo making sure that it isn't corrupt, if it is it will placed inside of a folder called "Corrupt Files". If the metadata isn't readable these phtotos will be placed inside of a folder called "None". 

# Before & After
<img src="before%20&%20after/before.PNG" width="50%"><img src="before%20&%20after/after.jpg" width="50%">

# Warning
Have not tested on Linux, this will likely have issues with Ubuntu but it should be a simply fix once I get time. Only Windows tested for now.

# Usage
Install Pillow through PIP. Go to your commandline and do "pip install pillow". Now that's basically it. Put the script inside the directory with all your photos and run it.
